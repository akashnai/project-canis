Canis Major and the constellation Canis Minor, the “lesser dog,” are widely regarded as two hunting hounds that follow Orion, the great hunter of ancient Greek legends. The hounds are often pictured chasing a hare, represented by the constellation Lepus, which lies west of Canis Major at Orion's feet.
